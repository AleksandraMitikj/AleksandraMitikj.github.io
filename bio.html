    <p> I'm Aleksandra Mitic and I come from Macedonia. I'm 20 years old and I can be your ski instructor.
      Skiing is my first love. I got on skis when I was only three years old, and already at four I was going down the slopes independently.
      Skiing is my greatest passion, and this passion led me to become a professional ski instructor.</p>
    <p>With years of experience and dedication, I have learned a lot about the techniques and skills needed for successful skiing.
      As a ski instructor, I share my love for skiing with my students and
      help them improve their skills and confidence on the slopes.</p>
    <p>Each lesson with me is tailored to the needs and level of the student, ensuring an enjoyable and safe experience.
      Whether you are a beginner or an experienced skier,
      my focus is on your progress and enjoyment of this wonderful sport.</p>
