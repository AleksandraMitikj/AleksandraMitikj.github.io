    <h3>High School</h3>
    <p>
      I finished secondary education at the "Goce Delchev" high school in Kumanovo.
      I was part of the mathematics department and passed all four years with a grade of 5.00.
      I was also among the ten best students of my generation.
      My secondary education helped me to develop my skills and knowledge in mathematics,
      informatics and natural sciences, enabling me to achieve my goals and continue a successful education.

    <h3>Faculty</h3>
    <p>
      I am currently enrolled in the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje.
      I am in my first year, specializing in Software Engineering and Information Systems.
      This field excites me as it merges the logical rigor of engineering with the creative possibilities of technology.
      I believe that through software, we can solve complex problems and create innovative solutions that shape the future.
      My journey in this field is not just about acquiring technical skills but
      also about understanding the deeper impact of technology on society and our daily lives.
